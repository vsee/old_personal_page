# Phd
### User Experience Driven CPU Frequency Scaling on Mobile Devices Towards Better Energy Efficiency

In this work I analysed how interactive Android workloads can automatically be captured, replayed and benchmarked for user experience. I applied the resulting methodology to analyse standard DVFS governors and implemented an improved governor using reinforcement learning.

Have a look at the [abstract](/docs/thesis/abstract.pdf) or the [lay summary](/docs/thesis/laysummary.pdf) for more details. The full thesis will also be online soon.

# Awards

In October 2014 I won the **Best Paper Award** for my publication <a href="/docs/papers/measuring_qoe_IISWC2014.pdf"> *&#8220;Measuring QoE of Interactive Workloads and Characterising Frequency Governors on Mobile Devices.&#8221;*</a> at the <a href="http://www.iiswc.org/iiswc2014/index.html">IISWC</a> conference in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.
					        
In September 2011 I won the **Science Engineering & Technology Award (SET Award)** in the category Best Information Technology Student 2011 for my contribution: *Simulator for an Embedded Multi-Core Architecture*

This award was presented in the Millenium Hotel in Lodon by Andy Green, CEO of <a href="http://www.logica.com/">logica</a>.
